/home/pwrap/workspace-c/SimpleGa/SimpleGa/population.c|201|error: conflicting types for ‘generate_population’|

- only adjusted order of header files fixed the problem
- or there can be include "xyz.h" in wrong header file
- an order of header files is important, e.g.


#include a
#include b

function(struct Member a, struct Member b){}
